## ⚙️ **Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account for database

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShreyashPrateek/spirit-esports.git
   cd spirit-esports
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in root directory
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Database Setup (Supabase)**
   ```sql
   -- Create tournaments table
   CREATE TABLE tournaments (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     date DATE NOT NULL,
     prizePool INTEGER NOT NULL,
     image VARCHAR(255),
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

## 🚀 **Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

    .limit(4);
};
```
